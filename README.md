## How cam controllers talk to server

The controller sends new images to server by using HTTP request.


the path is `/api/img`.

### request
the method is `POST`, the body is as following.
```
{
    img: string;
    ip: string;
    deviceName: string;
    takeAt: number;
}[]
```
`takenAt` should be unix timestamp in ms.
`img` should be image in jpeg format, encoded in base64.
### response
On success the server returns with status code 200, with an empty body.

## How img processing program talks to server

Generally, the img processing program send a HTTP request to retrieve the img it wants to process. Once the processing is done, it sends another HTTP request to server to update the objects table as well as the img object relation table.

### Retrieve the img from server

the path is `/api/img`

#### request
`GET`
the param should be `take_after` in unix timestamp in ms
```
/img?take_after=1522495009422
```

#### response
```
{
    data: {
        id: string;
        img: string;
        takenAt: number;
    }
}
```
`img` is the base64 code of the img in jpeg format
`createdAt` is the unix timestamp in ms

### Update the related object of imgs

the path is `/api/objects_of_imgs`

#### request
`POST`
```
{
    imgId: string;
    objects: string[];
}[]
```
_DONT_ send the raw img back, only send the img id back.

#### response
If the operation success the server will return a HTTP response with 200 code, and empty body.

## How frontend talks to server

The frontend should retrive the list of objects(for autocomplete) from server, as well as do the search.

### Autocomplete objects
Once the `/api/objects` is called, it returns all the objects names in the database.
the path is `/api/objects`

#### request
`GET`
```
/api/objects
```

#### response
```
{
    data: string[];
}
```
an array of the result

### search
the path is `/api/search`

### request
`POST`
```
{
    objects: string[]
}
```

### response
```
{
    data: {
        id: number,
        img: string,
        deviceName: string,
        ip: string,
        takenAt: number,
    }[];
}
```
`img` is the base64 code for the image in jpeg format
`takenAt` is the unix timestamp in ms.
